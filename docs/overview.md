# Overview

## Project Description
The University Database System is designed to manage student, professor, course, and enrollment information within a university setting. It supports registration, course management, 
academic advising, and reporting functionalities.

## Key Entities
- **Student**: Represents individuals enrolled in courses.
- **Professor**: Represents faculty members responsible for teaching courses.
- **Course**: Represents academic courses offered by the university.
- **Enrollment**: Represents student enrollment in specific courses.
- **Teaching**: Maps professors to courses they teach.
- **Prerequisites**: Defines course prerequisites required for enrollment.
- **Grades**: Tracks student grades for enrolled courses.
- **CourseFeedback**: Stores feedback provided by students for courses.
- **CourseMaterials**: Contains materials associated with specific courses.

## Database Schema
The database schema consists of interconnected tables:

- **Student**: Attributes include StudentID, Name, Email, PhoneNumber, Address, DateOfBirth.
- **Professor**: Attributes include ProfessorID, Name, Email, PhoneNumber, OfficeLocation.
- **Course**: Attributes include CourseID, CourseName, CourseCode, Credits.
- **Enrollment**: Tracks student enrollment in courses.
- **Teaching**: Maps professors to courses they teach in specific semesters.
- **Prerequisites**: Defines course prerequisites.
- **Grades**: Stores grades for enrolled students.
- **CourseFeedback**: Manages student feedback for courses.
- **CourseMaterials**: Contains additional materials related to courses.

## Project Goals
- Facilitate student registration and course enrollment processes.
- Support course management and curriculum planning for professors and administrators.
- Provide academic advisors with tools to track student progress and offer personalized guidance.
- Generate reports and analytics to aid in decision-making and semester planning.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes:

- **Database**: MySQL for data storage and retrieval.
- **SQL**: Stored procedures, views, and functions for data manipulation and reporting.
- **Programming Languages**: Possibly integrated with application logic using languages like Python or Java.
- **Web Technologies**: Front-end interfaces may interact with the database through APIs.

## Objective
The objective of the University Database System is to streamline academic operations, enhance communication between stakeholders, and provide insights into student performance and course management.

## User Roles

- **Students**: Register for courses, view grades, provide feedback.
- **Professors**: Manage course assignments, view student information.
- **Administrators**: Oversee database operations, generate reports.
- **Academic Advisors**: Track student progress, provide counseling.

## Project Timeline
- **Database Design and Implementation**: Define schema and tables - 2 weeks.
- **Stored Procedures and Views Development**: Create SQL logic - 2 weeks.
- **Integration and Testing**: Connect database with front-end - 3 weeks.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate functionality - 1 week.
- **Deployment and Maintenance**: Rollout and ongoing support - Ongoing.

## Conclusions
The University Database System offers a robust solution for academic institutions to manage student data, course offerings, and faculty assignments efficiently. By leveraging SQL 
stored procedures, views, and functions, the system enables seamless interactions between users and database entities, fostering a collaborative and data-driven educational environment. Adjustments and optimizations based on feedback and evolving requirements will ensure the system remains effective and scalable.
