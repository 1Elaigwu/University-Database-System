# University Database System Implementation Details

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: MySQL
- **Programming Languages**: SQL, possibly integrated with application logic using languages like Python or Java.
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench for schema design and query execution.

## Schema Creation
The database schema includes the following tables:

- **Student**: Stores student information.
- **Professor**: Manages professor details.
- **Course**: Represents academic courses.
- **Enrollment**: Tracks student enrollment in courses.
- **Teaching**: Associates professors with courses they teach.
- **Prerequisites**: Defines course prerequisites.
- **Grades**: Records student grades for courses.
- **CourseFeedback**: Collects feedback from students about courses.
- **CourseMaterials**: Contains additional resources related to courses.

## Tables Created
The schema creation script includes the creation of the above tables with appropriate attributes and relationships using InnoDB engine for data integrity.

## Data Insertion
Data can be inserted into tables using SQL INSERT INTO statements to populate student, professor, course, and related data necessary for the system's functionality.

## Views, Functions, and Stored Procedures
Stored Procedures:

- **RegisterStudentForCourse**: Registers a student for a course.
- **SendNotificationToStudent**: Sends notifications or alerts to students.
- **AssignProfessorToCourse**: Assigns professors to teach specific courses.
- **GetCourseMaterials**: Retrieves course materials for a given course.
- **GetCoursePrerequisites**: Retrieves course prerequisites.
- **GetCourseEnrollmentReport**: Generates enrollment reports for courses.
- **GetCourseFeedback**: Retrieves feedback for a specific course.
- **ForecastCourseDemand**: Forecasts course demand for an upcoming semester.

Functions:
- **GetStudentRecord**: Retrieves student information as a JSON string.
- **GetCoursePrerequisites**: Retrieves course prerequisites as a text string.
- **GetStudentAdvisor**: Retrieves the academic advisor's name for a student.

Views:
- **StudentEnrollmentHistory**: Tracks student enrollment history and course preferences.
- **ProfessorSchedule**: Manages scheduling office hours and professor workload.
- **CoursePrerequisites**: Assists in tracking course prerequisites and co-requisites.
- **StudentProgress**: Provides insights into student progress and completion rates.
- **StudentData**: Ensures data security and compliance with privacy regulations by exposing limited student information.

## Usage Examples

- **Registration and Enrollment**:
  - Use RegisterStudentForCourse procedure to enroll students in courses.
  - View StudentEnrollmentHistory to track student enrollment preferences.

- **Student Services**:
  - Use SendNotificationToStudent procedure to send notifications to students.
  - Retrieve student records using GetStudentRecord function.

- **Course Management**:
  - Assign professors to courses using AssignProfessorToCourse procedure.
  - View ProfessorSchedule to manage professor schedules.

- **Curriculum Planning**:
  - Retrieve course prerequisites using GetCoursePrerequisites procedure.
  - View CoursePrerequisites to track course prerequisites.

- **Student Progress Tracking**:
  - Monitor student progress and grades using StudentProgress view.
  - Generate enrollment reports with GetCourseEnrollmentReport procedure.

## Conclusion
The implementation of the University Database System leverages SQL stored procedures, views, and functions to provide comprehensive functionality for student registration, course 
management, academic advising, and reporting. By utilizing these database objects, the system efficiently handles data interactions and supports decision-making processes within the 
university environment.
Additional adjustments and optimizations can be made based on specific requirements and use cases to enhance the system's performance and usability.
